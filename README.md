# blog-website
This is a blog website cretaed by me. This was a challenge project from an udemy course.
I haven't uploaded one folder(node-modules) in the repository. And for this blog project to work, one needs to install all required modules which can be done by using some steps.
Steps are: 1. Open cmd prompt and make one folder(on desktop or whereever) and then clone all uploaded files(from my blog repository) there.
2. Then type these 4-lines of code to install all required modules for this project.   npm install express           --- to install express module
3.    npm install body-parser       --- to install bady-parser module
4.    npm install ejs               --- to install ejs module
5.    npm install lodash            --- to install lodash module

After doing all steps mentioned above, one can use this blog website.
